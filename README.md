# Youtube_downloader
This is a Python program to download YouTube videos.

# Description
This program automatically fetches a YouTube video from a link provided and downloads it to the user's downloads folder.
It features link error detection, false inputs, rejection of non-youtube links, and malware protection.
I am not a cybersecurity specialist so the program only rejects files with the .mkv extension, but a variable is added so you can change it if you would like. 

# Installation
You must install the module "pytube". This can be done via:

"pip install pytube"

All you need to do is run the code in your terminal (no administrator access required) and it will work!

Youtube_downloader supports all operating systems!
